## ðŸ”§ Lab Introduction: Compliance and Resilience with IBM Concert

This lab is built for engineers, architects, and technical practitioners who are responsible for maintaining compliance, managing risk, and ensuring operational resilience across hybrid and multicloud environments.

IBM Concert is designed to embed compliance and resilience directly into your operational workflows. Through policy-as-code and continuous posture management, Concert helps teams shift from reactive compliance checks to proactive, automated governance.

In this lab, youâ€™ll work through practical scenarios that cover the core capabilities of IBM Concert, including:

- [x] Installation and Configuration â€“ Deploy IBM Concert into your environment and connect it to your infrastructure.

- [x] Certificate Lifecycle Management â€“ Ingest, validate, and renew certificates to prevent outages and maintain secure communications.

- [x] Software Composition Analysis (SCA) â€“ Generate and manage SBOMs, and detect supply chain risks tied to open-source dependencies.

- [x] Policy Management â€“ Write, deploy, and test policies as code to monitor for compliance and resilience requirements.

- [x] Posture Monitoring and Remediation â€“ Detect non-compliance, configuration drift, or resiliency gaps and trigger automated remediation workflows.

ðŸ”¥ What You'll Walk Away With:

- A working knowledge of how to apply IBM Concert to manage compliance and resilience posture in real-time.

- Hands-on experience defining policies that continuously validate against internal controls and external standards (like CIS, NIST, or company-specific policies).

- Practical skills in automating certificate operations and managing software supply chain risks as part of your security posture.

- This lab is designed to be hands-on, outcome-driven, and directly applicable to real-world operational challenges. Whether you're responsible for platform engineering, site reliability, DevSecOps, or governance, this lab will give you the tools to embed compliance and resilience into the way your infrastructure runs.
