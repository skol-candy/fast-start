# IBM Toolchain Lab
By following this tutorial, you create an open toolchain that includes a Tekton-based delivery pipeline. You then use the toolchain and DevOps practices to develop a simple "Hello World" web application (app) that you deploy to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. 

[Tekton](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/tekton-a-modern-approach-to-continuous-delivery") is an open source, vendor-neutral, Kubernetes-native framework that you can use to build, test, and deploy apps to [Kubernetes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/kubernetes). Tekton provides a set of shared components for building [continuous integration](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-integration) and [continuous delivery](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/continuous-delivery) (CICD) systems. As an open source project, Tekton is managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation) (CDF). The goal is to modernize continuous delivery by providing industry specifications for pipelines, workflows, and other building blocks. With Tekton, you can build, test, and deploy across cloud providers or on-premises systems by abstracting the underlying implementation details. Tekton pipelines are built in to [ IBM Cloudâ„¢ Continuous Delivery.](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/build-and-deliver-using-tekton-enabled-pipelines).

After you create the cluster and the toolchain, you change your app's code and push the change to the Git Repos and Issue Tracking repository (repo). When you push changes to your repo, the delivery pipeline automatically builds and deploys the code.

## Prerequisites

1. You must have an IBM Cloud account. If you don't have one, sign up for a trial. The account requires an IBMid. If you don't have an IBMid, you can create one when you register.
2. Verify the [toolchains and tool integrations that are available](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-cd_about) in your region and IBM Cloud environment. A toolchain is a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

3. You need a Kubernetes cluster and an API key. You can create them by using either the UI or the CLI. You can create from the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create)

4. Create a container registry namespace to deploy the container we are goign to build. Youc an create from the [Container Registry UI](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/registry/main/namespaces)

5.  Create the API key by using the string that is provided for your key name.
    ```bash
    ibmcloud iam api-key-create my-api-key
    ```
    Save the API key value that is provided by the command.

## Create Continues Delivery Service Instance

## Explore the pipeline

With a Tekton-based delivery pipeline, you can automate the continuous building, testing, and deployment of your apps.

The Tekton Delivery Pipeline dashboard displays an empty table until at least one Tekton pipeline runs. After a Tekton pipeline runs, either manually or as the result of external Git events, the table lists the run, its status, and the last updated time of the run definition.

To run the manual trigger that you set up in the previous task, click **Run pipeline** and select the name of the manual trigger that you created. The pipeline starts to run and you can see the progress on the dashboard. Pipeline runs can be in any of the following states:

- Pending: The PipelineRun definition is queued and waiting to run.
- Running: The PipelineRun definition is running in the cluster.
- Succeeded: The PipelineRun definition was successfully completed in the cluster.
- Failed: The PipelineRun definition run failed. Review the log file for the run to determine the cause.
    ![Pipeline dashboard](../images/Pipeline_Dashboard.png)
  
- For more information about a selected run, click any row in the table. You view the Task definition and the steps in each PipelineRun definition. You can also view the status, logs, and details of each Task definition and step, and the overall status of the PipelineRun definition.
    ![Pipeline Log](../images/Pipeline_Details.png)
  
- The pipeline definition is stored in the `pipeline.yaml` file in the `.tekton` folder of your Git repository. Each task has a separate section of this file. The steps for each task are defined in the `tasks.yaml` file.


1. Review the pipeline-build-task. The task consists of a git clone of the repository followed by two steps:
    - pre-build-check: This step checks for the mandatory Dockerfile and runs a lint tool. It then checks the registry current plan and quota before it creates the image registry namespace if needed.
    - build-docker-image: This step creates the Docker image by using the IBM Cloud Container Registry build service through the `ibmcloud cr build` CLI script. 
2. Review the pipeline-validate-task. The task consists of a git clone of the repository, followed by the check-vulnerabilities step. This step runs the <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/va?topic=va-va_index#about&cm_mmc=IBMBluemixGarageMethod-_-MethodSite-_-10-19-15::12-31-18-_-vulnerability-advisor-docs" target="_blank">IBM Cloud Vulnerability Advisor</a> on the image to check for known vulnerabilities. If it finds a vulnerability, the job fails, preventing the image from being deployed. This safety feature prevents apps with security holes from being deployed. The image has no vulnerabilities, so it passes. In this tutorial template, the default configuration of the job is to not block on failure.
3. Review the pipeline-deploy-task. The task consists of a git clone of the repository followed by two steps:
    - pre-deploy-check: This step checks whether the IBM Container Service cluster is ready and has a namespace that is configured with access to the private image registry by using an IBM Cloud API Key. 
    - deploy-to-kubernetes: This step updates the `deployment.yml` manifest file with the image url and deploys the application using `kubectl apply`
4. After all the steps in the pipeline are completed, a green status is shown for each task. Click the **deploy-to-kubernetes** step and click the **Logs** tab to see the successful completion of this step.
    ![Pipeline success](../images/Tekton_Success.png)
5. Scroll to the end of the log. The `DEPLOYMENT SUCCEEDED` message is shown at the end of the log.
    ![Deployment succeeded](../images/Tekton_Deployment_Success.png)
6. Click the URL to see the running application.
    ![Running app](../images/Tekton_App.png)

## Modify the App Code 

In this task, you modify the application and redeploy it. You can see how your Tekton-based delivery pipeline automatically picks up the changes in the application on commit and redeploys the app. 

1. On the toolchain's Overview page, click the Git tile for your application. 
    - **Tip:** You can also use the built-in Eclipse Orion-based Web IDE, a local IDE, or your favorite editor to change the files in your repo.
2. In the repository directory tree, open the `app.js` file.
    ![File browser](../images/Tekton_Files.png)
3. Edit the text message code to change the welcome message. 
    ![Edit file](../images/Tekton_Commit.png)
4. Commit the updated file by typing a commit message and clicking **Commit changes** to push the change to the project's remote repository. 
5. Return to the toolchain's Overview page by clicking the back arrow.
6. Click **Delivery Pipeline**. The pipeline is running because the commit automatically started a build. Over the next few minutes, watch your change as it is built, tested, and deployed. 
    ![Dashboard redeployment](../images/Tekton_Redeploy.png)
7. After the deploy-to-kubernetes step is completed, refresh your application URL. The updated message is shown.


## Clean up Resources

In this task, you can remove any of the content that is generated by this tutorial. Before you begin, you need the IBM Cloud CLI and the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service CLI. Instructions to install the CLI are in the prerequisite section of this tutorial.


1. Delete the git repository, sign in into git, select personal projects. Then go to repository General settings and remove the repository.
1. Delete the toolchain. You can delete a toolchain and specify which of the associated tool integrations you want to delete. When you delete a toolchain, the deletion is permanent.
    - On the DevOps dashboard, on the Toolchains page, click the toolchain to delete. Alternatively, on the app's Overview page, on the Continuous delivery card, click **View Toolchain**.
    - Click the **More Actions** menu, which is next to **View app**.
    - Click **Delete**. Deleting a toolchain removes all of its tool integrations, which might delete resources that are managed by those integrations.
    - Confirm the deletion by typing the name of the toolchain and clicking **Delete**. 
    - **Tip:** When you delete a GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Git Repos and Issue Tracking tool integration, the associated repo isn't deleted from GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, or Git Repos and Issue Tracking. You must manually remove the repo.
1. Delete the cluster or discard the namespace from it. It is easiest to delete the entire namespace (Please do not delete the `default` namespace) by using the IBM Cloudâ„¢ Kubernetes Service CLI from a command-line window. However, if you have other resources that you need to keep in the namespace, you need to delete the application resources individually instead of the entire namespace. To delete the entire namespace, enter this command:
    ```bash
    kubectl delete namespace [not-the-default-namespace]
    ```
1. Delete your IBM Cloud API key.
  - From the **Manage** menu, click **Access (IAM)**. Click **IBM Cloud API Keys**.
  - Find your API Key in the list and select **Delete** from the menu to the right of the API Key name.
1. Delete the container images. To delete the images in your container image registry, enter this command in a command-line window:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cr image-rm IMAGE [IMAGE...]
    ```
    If you created a registry namespace for the tutorial, delete the entire registry namespace by entering this command:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud cr namespace-rm NAMESPACE
    ```
      - **Note:** You can run this tutorial many times by using the same registry namespace and cluster parameters without discarding previously generated resources. The generated resources use randomized names to avoid conflicts.


### Summary

You created a toolchain with a Tekton-based delivery pipeline that deploys a "Hello World" app to a secure container in a Kubernetes cluster. You changed a message in the app and tested your change. When you pushed the change to the repo, the delivery pipeline automatically redeployed the app.
