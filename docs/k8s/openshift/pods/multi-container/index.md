# Multi-Container Pod

Container images solve many real-world problems with existing packaging and deployment tools, but in addition to these significant benefits, containers offer us an opportunity to fundamentally re-think the way we build distributed applications. Just as service oriented architectures (SOA) encouraged the decomposition of applications into modular, focused services, containers should encourage the further decomposition of these services into closely cooperating modular containers. By virtue of establishing a boundary, containers enable users to build their services using modular, reusable components, and this in turn leads to services that are more reliable, more scalable and faster to build than applications built from monolithic containers.

1. This example shows how to use a Volume to communicate between two Containers running in the same Pod. 

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: shared-data
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: bitnami/nginx
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-data
              mountPath: /app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
        - name: sidecard
          image: busybox
          volumeMounts:
            - name: shared-data
              mountPath: /pod-data
          command:
            [
              "sh",
              "-c",
              "echo Hello from the side container > /pod-data/index.html && sleep 3600",
            ]
    ```

2. This example shows how to configure process namespace sharing for a pod. When process namespace sharing is enabled, processes in a container are visible to all other containers in the same pod.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: my-pod
    spec:
      shareProcessNamespace: true
      containers:
        - name: app
          image: bitnami/nginx
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
        - name: sidecard
          image: busybox
          securityContext:
            capabilities:
              add:
                - SYS_PTRACE
          stdin: true
          tty: true
    ```
