# Service Accounts

A service account provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod.

When you (a human) access the cluster (for example, using kubectl), you are authenticated by the apiserver as a particular User Account (currently this is usually admin, unless your cluster administrator has customized your cluster). Processes in containers inside pods can also contact the apiserver. When they do, they are authenticated as a particular Service Account (for example, default).

User accounts are for humans. Service accounts are for processes, which run in pods.

User accounts are intended to be global. Names must be unique across all namespaces of a cluster, future user resource will not be namespaced. Service accounts are namespaced.
