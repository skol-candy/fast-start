### Salesforce Connector

If you are using a demo or working with the Tech Jam labs, you will likely be interacting with a Sales Force System of Record (SoR).  To get started you require **admin** level access to your Salesforce account.  Create your free Salesforce account to test, making certain that you create a **Developer** account rather than a Trial account. If you connect to App Connect with a Trial account, the Salesforce events do not work.

To get your login URL, click on your user profile. The URL text below your Account Name is your login URL.

![alt text](./images/ace/1.png){ style='height: 500px;width: auto;'}

Once logged into your Salesforce account, on the left-hand Finder panel go to: **PLATFORM TOOLS > Apps > App Manager**

![alt text](./images/ace/2.png){ style='height: 500px;width: auto;'}

Create a **New Connected App** or use an existing one. Steps for creating a new app are as follows:

![alt text](./images/ace/3.png){ style='height: 500px;width: auto;'}

Provide a **Connect App Name** and the API Name is automatically generated by the system. Enter a Contact email (usually admin email address).  Be certain to **Enable OAuth Settings** and follow steps below to configure OAuth setting.

![alt text](./images/ace/4.png){ style='height: 500px;width: auto;'}

- Click on Enable OAuth Settings to get the configuration panel
- Either click on **Enable for Device Flow** and that will auto-generate Callback URL or alternately you can provide your own fully qualified Callback URL

Next, configure scope of access for our connectors which will be the **Connected App** in this case. Connectors technically only require **data api**, you can optionally choose to enable all the scopes for this connected app.

Choose `Save`.

It will take several minutes for newly created Connected App to be registered. Once registered return to the App Manager, select and view the created App:

Use Consumer Key and Secret as Client ID and Client Secret as needed in the connector template. Next, retrieve the Security Token. For this click on your user profile and select Settings option in the profile panel.

Under Settings, find and click **Reset Security Token**:

![alt text](./images/ace/8.png){ style='height: 500px;width: auto;'}

Click on Reset Security Token Button and it will send the newly generated security token to your admin email address. Save this token, you will use this as your your credentials when making connections.
